        Prakriti's journey with yoga began in the serene moments of her childhood, where she found solace and joy practicing alongside her neighbor, a nurturing yoga instructor. These early experiences sowed the seeds of a profound connection with yoga and meditation, a bond that would endure and flourish in the years to come. The tumultuous year of 2019, marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, became a pivotal moment for Prakriti. Seeking refuge from the chaos and uncertainty, she turned to yoga once more, this time with a newfound dedication and purpose. Starting with humble beginnings, following online videos and practicing diligently, Prakriti's passion for yoga blossomed. Her journey took a decisive turn when she embarked on a 200-hour yoga teacher training, a transformative experience that not only deepened her understanding of yoga but also ignited a burning desire to share its profound benefits with others. This training was a stepping stone towards her goal of helping people connect with yoga and adventure. Driven by her love for adventure, Prakriti pursued a Master's degree in Adventure Tourism Studies, equipping herself with the knowledge and skills to explore the uncharted territories of both the external world and her inner self. Her journey is a testament to the transformative power of yoga and adventure, inspiring others to embark on their own path of self-discovery and holistic well-being. Now, Prakriti is on a mission to combine her passions for yoga, adventure, and connecting with people. Armed with a trekking guide license and a heart full of dreams, she is determined to make a living out of doing what she loves the most. Through her endeavors, Prakriti seeks to not only enrich her own life but also to inspire and uplift those around her, guiding them towards a path of health, happiness, and harmony.
